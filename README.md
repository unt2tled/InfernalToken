**The most evil token ever created.**  
Welcome to the official internal token of Hell. This project is a demonstration of ERC20 token mechanics with a devilish twist, built using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin.

## About

InfernalToken is not just any ERC20 tokenâ€”it's cursed!  
- **Special transfer logic:** If the last digit of the transfer value is 6, the amount is multiplied by 6.
- **Requesting tokens:** Anyone can request a token by sending at least 66,666 wei to the contract.
- **Owner-only minting:** Only the contract owner can mint new tokens (if enabled).
